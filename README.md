# ReachTeeth
Moving homes is the number one reason people move dentists and ReachTeeth makes it easy for you to reach them soon after they’ve moved in to your area.

ReachTeeth prints and mails your marketing materials directly to new homeowners near you. So you can be sure you’re reaching patients at the right time, in the right way. By being the first dentist to reach out to them, you can establish a strong presence before your competitors. Get them in for an initial consultation before they start looking elsewhere.

Also, you're not just targeting an individual, everyone at the address will be looking for a new dentist. Have all of them using your services for years to come.

We can also design your marketing materials! ReachTeeth is the easiest way to put your dental marketing on autopilot and get a steady stream of new patients through your door.
